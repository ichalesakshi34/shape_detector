🎨 Interactive Shape Drawing and Voice Feedback System
📌 Project Overview

An interactive C++ graphics project that allows users to select shapes using mouse clicks.
When a shape is selected, it gets highlighted and its name is spoken aloud using the Windows Speech API.

🧠 Key Features
🖱️ Mouse-based interaction – Click on any shape from the menu.
🗣️ Voice feedback – The system speaks the name of the selected shape.
🎨 Visual highlighting – The chosen shape is filled with color.
🧩 Multiple shapes supported – Circle, Rectangle, Triangle, Oval, and Square.
⚡ Event-driven graphics – Built using BGI/WinBGIm graphics library.
🛠️ Technologies & Concepts Used

Language: C++
Graphics Library: <graphics.h>, <winbgim.h>
Speech: Windows PowerShell + System.Speech.Synthesis API

Concepts:

Functions
